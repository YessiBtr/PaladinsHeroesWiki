These points are earned by:\r\n\r\nTaking control of a Capture Point (+1)\r\nEscorting the Payload into the enemy team\'s base (+1)\r\nStalling the enemy team\'s Payload until the time runs out (+1)\r\nThere will be one Capture Point located at the very center of the area that players will need to fight for. To capture a point, at least one player needs to stand inside it\'s designated area. Each team has a separate capture progress bar that won\'t be depleted in any way. If players from both teams are standing in the capture point\'s radius, neither team will be able to make progress until their opponents are removed from the area. If a team is almost done capturing a point and is interrupted, there will be a 3 seconds delay before that team can resume capture.\r\n\r\nThe team that captures the Objective gains an additional 300 point for each player in the team. Once a Capture Point is taken by a team, a Payload cart spawns for them that must be escorted to the opposing team\'s base for an additional Objective Point. The Payload phase lasts 3 minutes, and during this phase the attacking team will spawn near the Capture Point. The payload will immediately stop moving if any players from the defending team stands near it. The payload will start to move backwards after sitting idle for too long.\r\n\r\nIf the timer runs out but there are still attackers around the objective an Overtime phase will begin, giving a last chance for the attackers to push and win. The overtime ends when either the payload reaches it\'s destination, or after 6 seconds of no attackers standing near the payload. The overtime counter will shorten the longer overtime lasts up to 1 second.

All items and Credits from the first round are reset at the start of the second one.\r\n\r\nWhen round one is complete, both teams swap sides. The Payload only advances when at least one attacker is close to it, but won\'t move if there are defenders close by. The payload will start to move backwards after sitting idle for too long without an attacker near it.\r\n\r\nDefenders can leave their base after 10 seconds, while attackers can only leave their base after 50 seconds.\r\n\r\nOn the first round, the attackers have 7 minutes to push the payload. On the second round, the attacks will either have 7 minutes or the time it took the attackers from the first round to push the payload all the way.\r\n\r\nThe team that got the Payload cart furthest will win the match. If both teams push the Payload cart all the way, then the team that pushed it to the end point in less time will win the match.

Once slain, players won\'t respawn until the next round starts.

The fog deals heavy ticks of True damage to any champion in it, forcing all players to move towards the center. Once the death fog reaches the epicenter, it will pause for 60s creating a final fight to the death. If the round is still active after a minute, the fog resumes and consumes the entire map.
